# Purpose

Prometheus is awesome, but the human mind doesn't work in PromQL. The intention of this repository is to become a simple place for people to provide examples of queries they've found useful.
We encourage all to contribute so that this can become something valuable to the community.

Simple or complex, all input is welcome.

# PromQL Examples

Please ensure all examples are submitted in the same format, we'd like to keep this nice and easy to read and maintain.

**Show Overall CPU usage for a server**
```
100 * (1 - avg by(instance)(irate(node_cpu{job='node',mode='idle'}[5m])))
```
*Summary:* Often useful to newcomers to Prometheus looking to replicate common host checks. Provides a overall metric for CPU usage, per instance.

---

**Track http error rates as a proportion of total traffic**
```
 rate(demo_api_request_duration_seconds_count{status="500",job="demo"}[5m]) * 50
> on(job, instance, method, path)
    rate(demo_api_request_duration_seconds_count{status="200",job="demo"}[5m])
```
*Summary:* This query selects the 500-status rate for any job, instance, method, and path combinations for which the 200-status rate is not at least 50 times higher than the 500-status rate like this:

**90th Percentile latentcy**
```
 histogram_quantile(0.9, rate(demo_api_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job="demo"}[5m])) > 0.05
and
    rate(demo_api_request_duration_seconds_count{job="demo"}[5m]) > 1
```
*Summary:*  Select any HTTP endpoints that have a 90th percentile latency higher than 50ms (0.05s) but only for the dimensional combinations that receive more than one request per second. We will use the histogram_quantile() function for the percentile calculation here. It calculates the 90th percentile latency for each sub-dimension. To filter the resulting bad latencies and retain only those that receive more than one request per second.

**HTTP request rate, per second.. an hour ago**
```
rate(api_http_requests_total{status=500}[5m] offset 1h)
```

*Summary:*  The `rate()` function calculates the per-second average rate of time series in a range vector. Combining all the above tools, we can get the rates of HTTP requests of a specific timeframe. The query below will calculate the per-second rates of all HTTP requests that occurred in the last 5 minutes an hour ago.

**Kubernetes Container Memory Usage**
```
sum by(kubernetes_pod_name) (container_memory_usage_bytes{kubernetes_namespace="kube-system"})
```

*Summary:* How much memory are the tools in the kube-system namespace using? Break it down by Pod and NameSpace!

# Alert Rules Examples


**Disk Will Fill in 4 Hours**
```
predict_linear(node_filesystem_free{job='node'}[1h], 4*3600)
```
*Summary:* Asks Proemtheus to predict if the hosts disks will fill within four hours, based upon an hour of sampled data.

---

**Alert on High Memory Load**
```
  IF (sum(node_memory_MemTotal) - sum(node_memory_MemFree + node_memory_Buffers + node_memory_Cached) ) / sum(node_memory_MemTotal) * 100 > 85
```
*Summary:* Trigger an alert if a host memory is almost full.
